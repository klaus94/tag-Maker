tag-maker
#########

this program can automatically fill in the tags: title and interpret from a mp3-file, 
if the name is like "[auther] - [title]"


To have a nice icon, that executes the program:

1) copy the "icon_music.png" to "/home/.local/share/icons"

2) edit "music_nice.txt" line 3: Exec=python [directory, where the py-file is]

3) copy the "music_nice.txt" to "/home/.local/share/application"

4) rename "music_nice.txt" to "music_nice.desktop"

5) copy "music_nice.desktop" to your desktop

6) make "music_nice.desktop" executable:
	- right-click --> properties --> access rights --> execute file as program
	- OR: open terminal --> change directory to your desktop --> type in: "chmod +x music_nice.desktop"
	
7) alright, you should see the "M"-icon instead of the .desktop file
